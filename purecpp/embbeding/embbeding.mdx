## Installation

To use **EmbeddingOpenAI**, you need to install the `pureai` Python package:

```bash
pip install purecpp_embed
```

## Introduction

The **EmbeddingOpenAI** module generates vector embeddings using OpenAI's embedding model. These embeddings are numerical representations of text, useful for **semantic search**, **document similarity**, and **information retrieval**.

## Initialization

To use `EmbeddingOpenAI`, initialize an instance and set your OpenAI API key.

**Example:**

```python
from purecpp_embed import EmbeddingOpenAI

embedding = EmbeddingOpenAI()
embedding.SetAPIKey("your_openai_api_key")
```

## Generating Embeddings

The `GenerateEmbeddings` method takes a **list of strings** and returns their corresponding embeddings. Typically, these strings are extracted from the `page_content` attribute of chunks generated by a chunking module. However, you can also provide any list of text strings manually.

For more details on chunking, refer to the [Chunk documentation](../chunks/introduction.mdx).
### Example using predefined text strings  

```python
from purecpp_embed import EmbeddingOpenAI

# Initialize the embedding model
embedding = EmbeddingOpenAI()
embedding.SetAPIKey("your_openai_api_key")

# Example list of text strings (in practice, these would be chunked text segments)
text_chunks = [
    "This is the first example text chunk.",
    "Here is another chunk of text for embedding.",
    "Chunks help maintain context in large documents."
]

# Generate embeddings
embeddings = embedding.GenerateEmbeddings(text_chunks)

print(embeddings)
```

### Example using chunked text  

```python
from purecpp_embed import EmbeddingOpenAI

# Initialize the embedding model
embedding = EmbeddingOpenAI()
embedding.SetAPIKey("your_openai_api_key")

# Assume `chunks` is a list of chunk objects generated by a chunking module
# Each chunk has a `page_content` attribute containing text
chunks = chunk_module.ProcessDocuments()

# Extract text content from chunks
text_chunks = [chunk.page_content for chunk in chunks]

# Generate embeddings for the extracted text chunks
embeddings = embedding.GenerateEmbeddings(text_chunks)

print(embeddings)
```
