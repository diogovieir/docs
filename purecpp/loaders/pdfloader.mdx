title: PDF Loader
description: This data loader allows loading PDF files from local storage
---

## Installation

To use the PDFLoader, you first need to install the `purecpp` Python package.

```bash
pip install purecpp_extract
```

## Initialization

To start the PDFLoader, you can specify the number of workers to load data in parallel.

```python
from purecpp_extract import PDFLoader

pdf_loader = PDFLoader([], 4)  # 4 workers for parallel processing
```

## InsertDataToExtract

The following code demonstrates how to pass a PDF file path to **DataExtractRequestStruct** and use it to load data from a local file or directory.

To begin, create an instance of **DataExtractRequestStruct** from purecpp_libs 

This struct follows a standard format for loading various file types into data loaders. You can pass an array of **DataExtractRequestStruct** instances to the **InsertDataToExtract** method.

### Loading a Single File

```python
from purecpp_libs import DataExtractRequestStruct

data = DataExtractRequestStruct("/path/to/file.pdf")
pdf_loader.InsertDataToExtract([data])
```

### Loading a Directory

You can also load all PDF files from a directory by passing the folder path instead of a single file:

```python
data = DataExtractRequestStruct("/path/to/directory")
pdf_loader.InsertDataToExtract([data])
```

{/* ## Built-in Methods

Once the PDF file or directory is loaded into the data loader, you can use built-in functions to extract data efficiently.

> **Note:** If you loaded a directory, these methods will return results for each file within the directory.

### KeywordExists

Use this method to check whether a keyword exists in a loaded PDF file:

```python
pdf_loader.KeywordExists("/path/to/file.pdf", "keyword")
# pdf_loader.KeywordExists("/path/to/directory", "keyword")
``` */}

## GetKeywordOccurrences

Use this method to count how many times a specific word appears in a PDF document. If you loaded a directory, the method will return the count for each file in the directory.

```python
pdf_loader.GetKeywordOccurrences("keyword")
```

## GetTextContent

To extract the full content of a PDF file, use the **GetTextContent** method and pass the file identifier (the file name without the **.pdf**).

This method returns a **LoaderDataStruct** object, which you can use to process or embed the data in other **purecpp** modules.

Before calling this method, ensure you have previously used **InsertDataToExtract** to load the data.

```python
pdf_loader_content = pdf_loader.GetTextContent("/path/to/file")
```

If you loaded a directory, you must specify the identifier of a file within the directory to extract its content:

```python
pdf_loader_content = pdf_loader.GetTextContent("/path/to/directory/file")
```
