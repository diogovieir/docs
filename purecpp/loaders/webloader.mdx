title: WEB Loader
description: This data loader allows loading webpages from the internet.
---

## Installation

To use the `WebLoader`, you first need to install the `purecpp_extract` Python package:

```bash
pip install purecpp_extract
```

## Initialization

You can initialize the `WebLoader` by providing a single URL.

```python
from purecpp_extract import WebLoader

# Load a webpage from the internet
web_loader = WebLoader("https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brasil")
```

## Load

Once initialized, use the `Load()` method to fetch and extract content from the webpage. This method returns a list containing one `Document` object.

Each `Document` contains the following attributes:

- `metadata`: A dictionary with metadata about the document
- `page_content`: The full text content of the webpage

```python
documents = web_loader.Load()

for doc in documents:
    print(doc.metadata)
    print(doc.page_content)
```

- Since only a single URL is allowed per instance, the returned list will always contain exactly one `Document`.
