title: WEB Loader
description: This data loader allows loading webpages from the internet.
---

## Installation

To use the WebBaseLoader you first need to install the purecpp python package.

```bash
pip install purecpp_extract
```

## Initialization

To start the WebLoader, you can specify the number of workers to load data in parallel.

```python
from purecpp_extract import WebLoader
web_loader = WebLoader([], 12)
```

## InsertDataToExtract
The following code demonstrates how to pass a TXT file path to **DataExtractRequestStruct** and use it to load data from a single file.

To begin, create an instance of **DataExtractRequestStruct** from purecpp_libs 

This struct follows a standard format for loading various file types into data loaders. You can pass an array of **DataExtractRequestStruct** instances to the **InsertDataToExtract** method.

```python
from purecpp_libs import DataExtractRequestStruct

data = DataExtractRequestStruct("https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brasil")
web_loader.InsertDataToExtract([data])
```

## Built-in methods
Once the HTML page is loaded into the data loader, you can use built-in functions to extract data efficiently.

### KeywordExists
Use this method to check whether a keyword exists in an HTML document:
```python
web_loader.KeywordExists("https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brasil", "Fortaleza")
```

### GetKeywordOccurences
Use this method to count the occurrences of a specific word in an HTML document:

```python
web_loader.GetKeywordOccurences("Fortaleza")
```

## GetTextContent
To extract data from a website, use the **GetTextContent** method.

This method returns a **LoaderDataStruct** object, which you can use to create chunks and embed data in other **purecpp** modules.

Before calling this method, ensure you have previously used InsertDataToExtract to load the data.
```python
web_loader_content = web_loader.GetTextContent("https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brasil")
```
