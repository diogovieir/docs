# Data Loaders

Data loaders transform data into the standard PureAI format.

Each loader follows a unified structure, providing the same methods and usage approach.

## Install

Before you begin, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

  - **Python 3.10 or newer**: PureRAG is compatible with the latest versions of Python.
  - **pip**: Ensure pip is installed and updated to the latest version.

run:
```bash
pip install RagPUREAI_extract
```

## Loaders
The library currently includes four loaders: WebLoader, TXTLoader, DOCXLoader, and PDFLoader.
