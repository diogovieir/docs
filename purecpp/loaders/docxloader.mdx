description: This data loader allows loading DOCX files from local storage.
---

## Installation

To use the `DOCXLoader`, you first need to install the `purecpp_extract` Python package:

```bash
pip install purecpp_extract
```

## Initialization

You can initialize the `DOCXLoader` by providing the path to a `.docx` file or a directory containing `.docx` files.

```python
from purecpp_extract import DOCXLoader

# Load a single DOCX file
docx_loader = DOCXLoader("/path/to/file.docx")

# Load all DOCX files from a directory
docx_loader = DOCXLoader("/path/to/directory")
```

## Load

Once initialized, use the `Load()` method to extract the contents of the files. This method returns a list of `Document` objects.

Each `Document` contains the following attributes:

- `metadata`: A dictionary with metadata about the document
- `page_content`: The full text content of the document

```python
documents = docx_loader.Load()

for doc in documents:
    print(doc.metadata)
    print(doc.page_content)
```

- If a single file path was provided during initialization, the returned list will contain one `Document`.
- If a directory path was provided, the list will contain one `Document` per `.docx` file found in the directory.
