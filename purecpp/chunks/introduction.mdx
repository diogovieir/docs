title: Introduction - Chunks
description: Chunking modules split large pieces of text into smaller, manageable segments. Overlapping helps maintain context between chunks, making them essential for **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipelines and other text-processing tasks.

## **Installation**

Before you begin, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

  - **Python 3.10 or newer**: PureRAG is compatible with the latest versions of Python.
  - **pip**: Ensure pip is installed and updated to the latest version.

run:
```bash
pip install purecpp_extract
```

## **Chunking Modules**

The library includes four main chunking modules: **ChunkDefault**, **ChunkCount**, **ChunkQuery**, and **ChunkSimilarity**.

| **Module**           | **Description** |
|----------------------|----------------|
| [ChunkDefault](chunkdefault) | Splits large texts into smaller chunks while maintaining context through overlap. |
| [ChunkCount](chunkcount) | Segments text based on a specific count pattern. |
| [ChunkQuery](chunkquery) | Filters and retrieves chunks most relevant to a given query. |
| [ChunkSimilarity](chunksimilarity) | Splits and ranks chunks based on their similarity. |
