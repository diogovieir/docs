# PureCPP Setup

<Note>
PureCPP is a completely independent product from PureRouter. You can use PureCPP without needing PureRouter and vice versa.
</Note>

PureCPP is a high-performance RAG framework developed in C++, offered as a separate and independent product from PureAI. This guide will help you set up your development environment to start using PureCPP.

## System Requirements

Before you begin, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- Operating System: Windows 10/11, macOS 10.15+, or Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+, CentOS 7+)
- Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- 8GB RAM (16GB recommended for processing large documents)
- Disk space: at least 2GB for the library and dependencies

## Installation

To install PureCPP, use pip:

```bash
pip install purecpp
```

PureCPP is available as a Python package that provides bindings for the high-performance C++ library.

## Project Configuration

After installation, you can import and use PureCPP in your Python project:

```python
import purecpp
from purecpp.loaders import PdfLoader, TxtLoader, WebLoader, DocxLoader
from purecpp.chunks import DefaultChunker
from purecpp.embedding import EmbeddingModel

# Usage example
loader = PdfLoader()
documents = loader.load("path/to/your/document.pdf")

chunker = DefaultChunker(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200)
chunks = chunker.split_documents(documents)
```

## Verifying Installation

Create a simple Python file to verify everything is working correctly:

```python
import purecpp

print(f"PureCPP version: {purecpp.__version__}")
print("Installation successful!")
```

Run the file:

```bash
python verify_installation.py
```

If everything is configured correctly, you will see the PureCPP version printed to the console.

## Configuring Embedding Models

PureCPP supports various embedding models. To use pre-trained models, you can configure them like this:

```python
from purecpp.embedding import EmbeddingModel

# Download and configure the model (only on first execution)
embedding_model = EmbeddingModel.from_pretrained("sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2")

# Generate embeddings
texts = ["Example text 1", "Example text 2"]
embeddings = embedding_model.embed_documents(texts)
```

The model download is done only once. Files are stored in a local cache directory.

## Next Steps

Now that you have configured your environment, you are ready to start using PureCPP. Check out the [Quickstart Guide](/purecpp/quickstart) to create your first RAG application.
