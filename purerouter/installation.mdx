# PureRouter Installation

<Note>
PureRouter is a completely independent product from PureCPP. You can use PureRouter without needing PureCPP and vice versa.
</Note>

## Requirements

Before installing PureRouter, make sure you have:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- An account on the PureAI platform with a valid API key

## Installation via pip

The simplest way to install PureRouter is using pip:

```bash
pip install purerouter
```

## Verifying Installation

To verify that PureRouter was installed correctly, you can run:

```bash
pip list | grep purerouter
```

You should see the `purerouter` package listed with its current version.

## Initial Configuration

After installation, you'll need to configure the client with your API key:

```python
from purerouter import PureRouter
from purerouter.types import InferRequest, InvokeRequest

# Initialize the client with your router API key
client = PureRouter(router_key="your-api-key-here")

# Test the connection
response = client.router.infer(InferRequest(prompt="Hello, world!", profile="economy"))
print(response.output_text)
```

<Note>
You need to obtain a valid API key from the PureAI platform. This key allows access to the different routing profiles and deployments configured in your account.
</Note>
