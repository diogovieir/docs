# Routing Profiles

<Note>
PureRouter is a completely independent product from PureCPP. You can use PureRouter without needing PureCPP and vice versa.
</Note>

PureRouter offers three main routing profiles that allow you to balance cost, quality, and speed according to your specific needs.

## Available Profiles

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Economy" icon="piggy-bank">
    The **Economy** profile is cost-optimized, directing your queries to more economical models that can still provide adequate responses for simple tasks.
    
    **Ideal for:**
    - Simple and direct queries
    - Basic text processing tasks
    - Scenarios where budget is a primary concern
    - Applications with high query volume
    
    ```python
    # Example using the Economy profile
    response = client.router.infer(InferRequest(
        prompt="What is the capital of Brazil?",
        profile="economy"
    ))
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Balanced" icon="scale-balanced">
    The **Balanced** profile offers a balance between cost and quality, being the default option for most use cases.
    
    **Ideal for:**
    - General and everyday use
    - Medium complexity tasks
    - When you need reasonable quality responses without excessive costs
    - Applications with varied needs
    
    ```python
    # Example using the Balanced profile
    response = client.router.infer(InferRequest(
        prompt="Explain how photosynthesis works in simple terms.",
        profile="balanced"
    ))
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Quality" icon="gem">
    The **Quality** profile prioritizes response quality, directing your queries to the most advanced models available.
    
    **Ideal for:**
    - Complex and specialized tasks
    - Creative content generation
    - Advanced reasoning and problem solving
    - When precision and quality are critical
    
    ```python
    # Example using the Quality profile
    response = client.router.infer(InferRequest(
        prompt="Write a detailed essay on the ethical implications of artificial intelligence in modern society.",
        profile="quality"
    ))
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Profile Comparison

| Feature | Economy | Balanced | Quality |
|---------|---------|----------|----------|
| **Cost** | Low | Medium | High |
| **Quality** | Basic | Good | Excellent |
| **Supported complexity** | Low | Medium | High |
| **Creativity** | Limited | Moderate | High |
| **Reasoning** | Basic | Good | Advanced |
| **Ideal use** | Simple tasks, high volume | General use | Complex, specialized tasks |

## Choosing the Right Profile

<Steps>
  1. **Evaluate task complexity** - Simple tasks can use Economy, while complex tasks need Quality
  
  2. **Consider your budget** - If cost is a primary concern, start with Economy and scale as needed
  
  3. **Test different profiles** - Compare results to find the best balance for your specific use case
  
  4. **Analyze query volume** - For high volume, Economy may be more suitable; for low volume critical queries, Quality may be justified
</Steps>

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Customer Service Chatbot

```python
def customer_service_bot(query, importance):
    # Use Economy for simple FAQ questions
    if is_faq(query):
        return client.router.infer(InferRequest(
            prompt=query,
            profile="economy"
        ))
    
    # Use Balanced for most queries
    elif importance == "normal":
        return client.router.infer(InferRequest(
            prompt=query,
            profile="balanced"
        ))
    
    # Use Quality for VIP customers or critical issues
    elif importance == "high":
        return client.router.infer(InferRequest(
            prompt=query,
            profile="quality"
        ))
```

### Example 2: Writing Assistant

```python
def writing_assistant(task_type, content):
    if task_type == "grammar_check":
        # Simple grammar corrections can use Economy
        return client.router.infer(InferRequest(
            prompt=f"Correct the grammatical errors in the following text: {content}",
            profile="economy"
        ))
    
    elif task_type == "rewrite":
        # Text rewrites use Balanced
        return client.router.infer(InferRequest(
            prompt=f"Rewrite the following text to make it clearer and more concise: {content}",
            profile="balanced"
        ))
    
    elif task_type == "creative_content":
        # Creative content uses Quality
        return client.router.infer(InferRequest(
            prompt=f"Create creative and engaging content about: {content}",
            profile="quality"
        ))
```
