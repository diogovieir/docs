# Pricing Overview

PureAI uses a credit-based billing system. Purchase credits in USD and use them to deploy and run models on GPU instances.

## How It Works

1. **Purchase Credits**: Add credits to your account via Stripe
2. **Deploy Models**: Select a model and instance type
3. **Pay Per Hour**: Credits are charged per hour of active deployment
4. **Monitor Usage**: Track costs in the dashboard

## Pricing Model

| Component | Pricing |
|-----------|---------|
| Credits | 1 credit = $1 USD |
| Deployments | Per-hour based on instance type |
| API Calls | Included in deployment cost |

## Credit Purchase Options

| Amount | Credits |
|--------|---------|
| $5 | 500 credits |
| $10 | 1,000 credits |
| $20 | 2,000 credits |
| $50 | 5,000 credits |
| $100 | 10,000 credits |
| Custom | Minimum $1 |

## Cost Example

**Deploying LLaMA 3.1 8B on GPU XS:**

| Component | Cost |
|-----------|------|
| Instance | ~$0.20/hour |
| 8 hours of usage | ~$1.60 |
| 24 hours of usage | ~$4.80 |

## Instance Tiers

| Tier | Starting Price | Models |
|------|----------------|--------|
| XS | ~$0.20/h | 7B - 13B |
| S | ~$0.60/h | 13B - 34B |
| M | ~$1.80/h | 30B - 70B INT4 |
| L | ~$3.50/h | 70B FP16 |
| XL | ~$12.00/h | 70B - 180B |
| XXL | ~$20.00/h | 405B |

<Note>
Prices are spot prices and may vary based on availability. On-demand pricing is higher.

## Cost Management

- **Auto-pause**: Deployments can be paused when not in use
- **Alerts**: Set up notifications for usage thresholds
- **Dashboard**: Real-time cost tracking and projections
