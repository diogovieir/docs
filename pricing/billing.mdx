# Billing

Manage your credits, payments, and billing settings.

## Credit System

Credits are the currency used to pay for deployments:

- **1 credit = $1 USD**
- Credits are deducted per hour of active deployment
- Unused credits remain in your account

## Adding Credits

### Via Dashboard

1. Navigate to **Billing** tab
2. Click **Add Credits**
3. Select amount or enter custom value
4. Complete payment via Stripe

### Purchase Options

| Amount | Credits | Best For |
|--------|---------|----------|
| $5 | 500 | Testing |
| $10 | 1,000 | Small projects |
| $20 | 2,000 | Regular use |
| $50 | 5,000 | Production |
| $100 | 10,000 | Heavy usage |
| Custom | Min $1 | Flexible |

## Billing Cycle

Deployments are charged per hour:

```
Hourly Cost = Instance Price × Hours Running
```

**Example:**
- GPU S instance: ~$0.60/hour
- Running for 10 hours: ~$6.00 total

## Credit Deduction

Credits are deducted:
- When deployment starts (first hour)
- Every hour while deployment is running
- Partial hours are rounded up

## Auto-Refill

Enable automatic credit refill to avoid service interruption:

1. Go to **Billing** > **Auto-Refill**
2. Enable auto-refill
3. Set refill amount (how much to add)
4. Set threshold (when to refill)

**Example:**
- Threshold: 500 credits
- Refill amount: 2,000 credits
- When balance drops below 500, automatically add 2,000 credits

## Cost Optimization Tips

### 1. Choose Right Instance

Don't over-provision. A 7B model doesn't need Tier L.

### 2. Use Quantized Models

AWQ/INT4 models run on cheaper instances with similar quality:

| Model | FP16 Instance | AWQ Instance | Savings |
|-------|---------------|--------------|---------|
| 70B | GPU L ($3.50/h) | GPU M ($1.80/h) | ~48% |

### 3. Pause When Not Needed

Stop deployments during off-hours:
- Pause overnight
- Pause weekends
- Use auto-scaling

### 4. Monitor Usage

Check the Cost Analysis dashboard regularly to identify:
- Underutilized deployments
- Expensive requests
- Optimization opportunities
